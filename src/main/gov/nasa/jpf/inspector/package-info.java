/**
 * JPF Inspector is a debugging tool for Java Pathfinder.
 *
 * You may attach the JPF Inspector to a program run using
 * the Java Pathfinder virtual machine to debug it and step through it. It supports breakpoints and single-step
 * execution (forward and backward) at different levels of granularity, and it allows the user to examine and modify
 * program state (threads, call stacks, and heap objects). Unlike with standard debuggers (GDB), it is also possible
 * to control thread scheduling explicitly.
